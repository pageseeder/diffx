<P fmcssattr = "1">Antimanic—Has not been established<Citeref
    Rid = "CXX57" Exclude-comma = "1"/><Citeref Rid = "CXX58"
    Exclude-comma = "1"/>. The mood-stabilising effect has been postulated
to relate to a reduction of catecholamine neurotransmitter concentration,
possibly mediated by lithium ion (Li<Emph Type = "Superscript">+</Emph>)
effect on Na<Emph Type = "Superscript">+</Emph>K<Emph
    Type = "Superscript">+</Emph> adenosine triphosphatase (Na<Emph
    Type = "Superscript">+</Emph>K<Emph Type = "Superscript">+</Emph>ATPase)
to produce improved transneuronal membrane transport of sodium ion.
An alternate postulate is that lithium may decrease cyclic adenosine
monophosphate (cyclic AMP) concentrations<Citeref Rid = "CXX58"
    Exclude-comma = "1"/>, which would result in decreased sensitivity
of hormonal-sensitive adenylcyclase receptors. Another hypothesis
is the “second messenger” theory of lithium's interference with
lipid inositol metabolism. This theory postulates that a group of
improperly regulated<Citeref Rid = "CXX41" Exclude-comma = "1"/> neurons
may be the underlying cause of manic symptoms. A phospholipase C-type
enzyme hydrolyses the plasma membrane-located lipid, phosphatidylinositol biphosphate,
to diacyglycerol and inositol triphosphate, postsynaptic second
messengers that contribute to chronic cell stimulation by altering electrical
activity in the neuron. Inositol formed during this process is<Citeref
    Rid = "CXX41" Exclude-comma = "1"/> recycled by the inositol
phospholipid-synthesising enzymes in the CNS. There is evidence
that cells in the CNS do not have access to plasma sources of inositol
but, instead, depend on the synthesis of inositol for the transduction
of neuronal signals. Lithium, in therapeutic concentrations, blocks
the activity of the enzyme, inositol-1-phosphatase, resulting in
a depletion of neuronal inositol and ultimately a decrease in the
levels of phosphatidylinositol biphosphate. The lipid will no longer
be able to stimulate the formation of adequate quantities of the
second messengers or alter electrical activity. Subsequent cells
in the CNS become relatively<Citeref Rid = "CXX41" Exclude-comma = "1"/> insensitive
to the agonist stimulation, and clinical improvement results.<Citeref

<Gen.dosing.sec>
<P fmcssattr = "1">Warning—Lithium toxicity can occur with doses
at or near therapeutic serum concentrations<Citeref Rid = "CXX57"
    Exclude-comma = "1"/><Citeref Rid = "CXX58" Exclude-comma = "1"/>.
Facilities for prompt and accurate serum lithium determinations
must<Citeref Rid = "CXX28" Exclude-comma = "1"/> be available during
therapy<Citeref Rid = "CXX57" Exclude-comma = "1"/>. Accurate patient evaluation
requires both clinical and laboratory analysis<Citeref Rid = "CXX57"
    Exclude-comma = "1"/>.</P>
<P fmcssattr = "2">During the acute manic phase, the patient may
have a greater ability to tolerate lithium. This tolerance decreases
as the manic symptoms subside and often necessitates a corresponding
dosage adjustment.<Citeref Rid = "CXX57" Exclude-comma = "1"/><Citeref
    Rid = "CXX58" Exclude-comma = "1"/></P>
<P fmcssattr = "2">During the acute manic phase, lithium administration
of 1000 to 2500 mg a day should usually produce effective serum
concentrations ranging from 0.8 to 1.4 mmol/L<Citeref Rid = "CXXA2"
    Exclude-comma = "1"/>, with weekly adjustments based on plasma
lithium concentrations.</P>
<P fmcssattr = "2">Usual serum lithium concentrations during long-term
care are 0.6 to 0.8 mmol/L, although some patients may need concentrations
of 0.8 to 1 mmol/L<Citeref Rid = "CXXA3" Exclude-comma = "1"/>.</P>
<P fmcssattr = "2">If a satisfactory therapeutic response to lithium
at the highest tolerated serum concentrations within the therapeutic
range<Citeref Rid = "CXX41" Exclude-comma = "1"/> is not achieved
within 3 weeks, lithium therapy should be discontinued.</P>
<P fmcssattr = "2">Because concurrent use of lithium with electroconvulsive
therapy (ECT) may result in delirium, it is recommended that lithium
be temporarily discontinued prior to administration of ECT<Citeref
    Rid = "CXXA7"/>.</P>
<Diet.nutri>
<P fmcssattr = "1">Since lithium decreases sodium reabsorption by
the renal tubules, a normal diet with an average consumption of
salt and adequate fluid intake, 2.5 to 3 litres of fluid per day,
is essential to prevent sodium depletion leading to lithium toxicity<Citeref
    Rid = "CXX57" Exclude-comma = "1"/><Citeref Rid = "CXX58"
    Exclude-comma = "1"/>.</P>
<P fmcssattr = "2">This medication may be taken with food, juice
or milk, if necessary, to lessen laxative action, stomach irritation,
tremors or weakness, by slowing absorption of lithium.<Citeref
    Rid = "CXX28" Exclude-comma = "1"/></P></Diet.nutri>
<Adverse.treat><Head fmcssattr = "0">For treatment of adverse effects</Head>
<P fmcssattr = "2">Early side effects—If slight hand tremor, mild
nausea or diarrhoea, unusual drowsiness, or acne do not subside
with continued treatment, a reduction in lithium dosage may be necessary<Citeref
    Rid = "CXX57" Exclude-comma = "1"/>. If hand tremor is especially
bothersome, shifting a majority of the dose to bedtime, decreasing
caffeine intake, or adding a beta-blocker such as propranolol may
be helpful.</P>
<P fmcssattr = "2">Suppression of thyroid activity—May necessitate
thyroid hormone replacement therapy<Citeref Rid = "CXX57"
    Exclude-comma = "1"/>.</P>
<P fmcssattr = "2">Urinary incontinence—Lowering dose of lithium
whenever possible, adding an anticholinergic agent or an antidepressant
with anticholinergic properties, or switching to another medication
for treatment of bipolar disorder<Citeref Rid = "CXX22"
    Exclude-comma = "1"/>.</P>
<P fmcssattr = "2">Polyuria—Lowering dose of lithium alone, whenever
possible. If the lower plasma lithium concentration is inadequate
to maintain a response, adding a thiazide diuretic and reducing
the lithium dose by 50%, then readjusting it to reproduce the original
plasma lithium concentration, may be effective.<Citeref Rid = "CXX41"
    Exclude-comma = "1"/></P>
<P fmcssattr = "2">Weight gain—May be safely and effectively treated
by limiting calorie intake with emphasis on adequate fluid and sodium
intake.</P></Adverse.treat></Gen.dosing.sec>
