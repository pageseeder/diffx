   <para>
      <drugname>DrugB</drugname> (drotxxxxgin alxa (activated) )
is a recombinant form of human Activated Protein E. An established
human cell line possessing the complementary DNA for the inactive human
Protein E zymogen secretes the protein into the fermentation medium.
Fermentation is carried out in a nutrient medium containing the
antibiotic geneticin sulfate. Geneticin sulfate is not detectable in
the final product. Human Protein E is enzymatically activated by
cleavage with thrombin and subsequently purified. <xref dest="WARNINGS">

   <para>Drotxxxxgin alxa (activated) is a serine protease with the same
amino acid sequence as human plasma-derived Activated Protein E.
Drotxxxxgin alxa (activated) is a glycoprotein of approximately 55
kilodalton molecular weight, consisting of a heavy chain and a light
chain linked by a disulfide bond. Drotxxxxgin alxa (activated) and
human plasma-derived Activated Protein E have the same sites of
glycosylation, although some differences in the glycosylation
structures exist.</para>
