alkaloids, semisynthetic derivatives, quaternary ammonium compounds,

muscarinic actions of acetylcholine on structures innervated by
postganglionic cholinergic nerves as well as on smooth muscles that
respond to acetylcholine but lack cholinergic innervation. These
postganglionic receptor sites are present in the autonomic effector
cells of the smooth muscle, cardiac muscle, sinoatrial and atrioventricular
nodes, and exocrine glands. Depending on the dose, anticholinergics
may reduce the motility and secretory activity of the gastrointestinal
system, and the tone of the ureter and urinary bladder and may have
a slight relaxant action on the bile ducts and gallbladder. In general,
the smaller doses of anticholinergics inhibit salivary and bronchial secretions,
sweating, and accommodation; cause dilatation of the pupil; and increase
the heart rate. Larger doses are required to decrease motility of
